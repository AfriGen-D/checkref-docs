## Quick Start

Get started with CheckRef in just a few commands:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AfriGen-D/checkref.git
cd checkref

# Run with your data
nextflow run main.nf \
  --targetVcfs your_file.vcf.gz \
  --referenceDir /path/to/reference/panels/ \
  --outputDir results \
  -profile singularity
```

## What CheckRef Does

This Nextflow pipeline provides:

- **Allele Switch Detection**: Compares your VCF against reference panels to identify orientation issues
- **Smart Correction**: Choose to remove problematic variants or fix them by swapping REF/ALT alleles
- **Quality Assessment**: Comprehensive statistics and validation reports
- **Multi-File Support**: Process multiple chromosomes simultaneously with automatic matching
